The compilation of most files is done either in XCode or Visual Studio. Sometimes I use g++, gcc or gdb directly from the terminal, so you can try that, too if you haven't already!

DISCLAIMER: These files are only for studying and teaching purposes!
They are not intendet to be a direct example of good coding practices 
or C/C++ expert usage.
